# README

This app is a workflow test for using docker on a rails project from dev to prod.

* [x] easy first deploy

 (no manual install of ruby, nginx, postgresql, gems...)

 should I automate create database, migrate, seed in dockerfile ?

* [x] automate config of necessary processus (nginx)

* [ ] remote deployment

* [ ] Zero downtime deployment

* [ ] Pre-production

 (launching the app on the production server without remove the old version. Able to go back on the old version easily)

* [ ] continuous integration (with wercker)

* [ ] scaling horizontaly

* [ ] scaling verticaly



## Wondering

Can I simplify the restart of docker if the server is shutdown then up again?

env variable?

How the image stack up ? How avoid to get too much harddrive taken [here ? :)](https://gist.github.com/ngpestelos/4fc2e31e19f86b9cf10b)
